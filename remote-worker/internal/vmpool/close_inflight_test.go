// teardown-bulk fail on its first execution — and it is the LEAK, not the bulk path,
// that was at fault (see the ledger's "teardown-bulk diagnosed" entry).
//
// replenishOne's post-warm `case p.closed` branch already destroys a VM whose warming
// finished after Close, so the bookkeeping is right. What was missing is that Close did
// not WAIT for that branch to run. In a long-lived daemon that is merely untidy; in a
// process that exits when Close returns — every vmpoolctl invocation, so every E10 rung
// — the goroutine is killed mid-Restore and the jailer it already spawned survives it
// (Setpgid with no Pdeathsig, launcher_firecracker_unix.go), leaving a LIVE firecracker
// holding that VM id's API socket. The next process to mint the same id then dials that
// socket, finds a listener, and PUTs /snapshot/load into a microVM that is already
// loaded: Firecracker's "not supported after starting the microVM" (400).
//
// On the rig this fired on 1 run in 8 — a race, which is why it survived every earlier
// run of rungs 2 and 3 and only surfaced once a mode minted enough ids to reach the
// leaked one.
