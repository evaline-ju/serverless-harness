// path") happens off both the lock and the request path.

// cannot be ordered after that write. Without this, a sweep racing a real-clock
// ticker firing near shutdown could send on a channel Close had already closed.

// This is spec §4.2's second trigger, and it is not redundant with the per-Exec one:
// "a host whose last run went quiet receives no further Exec to hang a sweep off."
// The tier above gets this for free because every lease acquirer touches one shared
// ZSET, so a dead member is guaranteed to meet the next arrival
// (sandbox-lease.ts:15-17). Here the state is a per-run map, so nothing guarantees
// an arrival that would look at the quiet run.
//
// Re-arming from inside the callback is only safe because p.cfg.ReclaimScanInterval
// is guaranteed strictly positive — Config.Normalize either accepts a positive
// value or derives StandbyIdle/4 from a StandbyIdle that Normalize has already
// forced positive. That guarantee is LOAD-BEARING: fakeClock's Advance fires a
// timer whose deadline is at-or-before its target, so a self-re-arming timer with
// a zero (or negative) duration would re-arm at a deadline equal to — never past —
// the current virtual time and spin forever inside a single Advance call. Never
// arm this ticker with a duration that could be <= 0.
