// tombstoneSeq keeps two detachments of the same key in one process from colliding. The

//
// THIS IS WHAT MAKES REMOVAL SAFE OFF THE LOCK. The sweep decides to reclaim under p.mu
// but os.RemoveAll runs later, on the reclaim goroutine, after up to
// MaxReclaimsPerScan destroys (SIGKILL + Wait + jail teardown each) — a window long
// enough for a new Exec for the same key to pass runLocked, re-create the directory and
// restore a VM into it. The removal would then delete the tree out from under a running
// command, and on the Firecracker arm the guest would keep writing to a now-unlinked
// workspace.img inode (the jail hardlink keeps it alive), so the writes would vanish
// SILENTLY rather than failing. That is spec §2.3's isolation property — the one this
// tier exists to provide — broken by the housekeeping.
//
// Renaming instead of re-checking removes the window rather than shrinking it: after the
// rename the queued path is one no key can name, and a re-created run gets a fresh
// directory at the original path, a different inode from the one being removed. A
// re-check under the lock at removal time would still leave the gap between the check
// and RemoveAll, and holding p.mu across a recursive delete would put an rm -rf of a
// 2 GiB image in front of every other run's Exec.
//
// A tombstone left behind by a crashed worker is no worse than the workspace it replaced,
// which also survives a crash today with nothing that reclaims it — a restarted worker
// starts with an empty runs map and never sweeps a directory it does not know about.
