// because that is where this package's own tests run day to day) — this stub exists so
// that fact is a deliberate, documented choice rather than an accidental compile
// failure on a platform nobody was checking. SweepOrphans itself is otherwise
// platform-independent (directory walking, cgroup.procs parsing), so without this file
// GOOS=windows would fail on a single missing symbol deep in an unrelated call chain,
// which is a worse failure mode than a clear error at the one call site that would
// ever reach it.

// killPidIgnoringAbsent, which refuses outright on this platform — nothing can be
// signalled for the check to have failed to protect.
