// runPool is one workspace_key's state — spec §4.2's second state machine:
//
//	RunAbsent --first Exec--> RunWarming --> RunActive --idle > StandbyIdle--> RunParked
//	RunParked --Exec (cold acquire)--> RunWarming
//	RunParked --idle > WorkspaceIdle--> RunReclaiming --> RunAbsent
//
// RunParked is the state a run on a human gate or awaiting user input sits in:
// workspace on disk, ZERO standby VMs, costing disk rather than RAM (spec §4.4).
//
// Every field is guarded by pool.mu. Nothing here takes a lock of its own — one
// lock, held briefly, is what keeps the per-Exec sweep a microsecond map walk.

	ready    []VM // paused standbys, ready to acquire
	inFlight int  // VMs currently running a command for this key
	warming  int  // replenishments in flight

	// settled is closed whenever a warming completes, then replaced. A cold
	// acquire waits on it rather than starting a second warming (spec §4.2).

	// execGate is the ONE field here that is NOT guarded by pool.mu and synchronizes
	// on its own — deliberately, because what it protects (a VM's Resume and Run,
	// which dial vsock and block on a guest) must never happen while pool.mu is
	// held. ExecPhased holds it from a successful acquire until this VM is
	// destroyed, but only when the Launcher reports SerializesExecsPerRun():
	// Firecracker's ext4 workspace is not a shared-disk filesystem, so a second
	// guest mounting it rw while the first still holds it would corrupt it
	// (spec §4.3).
	//
	// A ONE-SLOT CHANNEL, NOT A MUTEX, because a mutex acquisition is not selectable
	// on a context. A waiter parked on sync.Mutex.Lock held an acquired VM with the
	// budget charged and no destroy defer registered yet, and cancelling its context
	// did not release any of it — so one wedged guest blocked every subsequent Exec
	// for that run indefinitely, each waiter's VM charged against
	// MaxCommittedBytes and each keeping rp.busy() true so the sweep could not
	// reclaim the workspace either. A send that can lose the race to runCtx.Done()
	// lets an aborted or timed-out waiter unwind instead of queueing behind a guest
	// that is never going to answer. Created in runLocked: unlike a zero Mutex, a
	// nil channel would block forever.
