// Spec §8's last gate: "Nothing executes outside a VM — §3.5's privilege property: no
// `bash` child of microvm-worker on any code path."
//
// A runtime test cannot prove a NEGATIVE over all code paths, so this is a static one:
// no file reachable from microvm-worker may spawn a process, with the deliberate
// exceptions named below. That is a stronger claim than any single execution, and it is
// the claim §3.5's whole privilege argument rests on — the privileged process only
// parses a frame, writes bytes to a vsock, and spawns a VMM with fixed argv.
//
// Final review M1 found this pin blind in two directions, and both are fixed here:
//
//   - It keyed detection on the literal identifier `exec`, while FOUR non-test files in
//     the very package it scanned import os/exec as `osexec` — the package's dominant
//     local convention (launcher_chv_unix.go, launcher_chv_other.go,
//     launcher_firecracker_unix.go, launcher_firecracker_other.go, plus
//     internal/exec/runner_unix.go and runner_other.go). An `osexec.Command("bash", …)`
//     in any of them, or in a new file following their convention, passed the gate. The
//     import name is now RESOLVED from each file's own AST, so whatever a file calls the
//     package is what the walk looks for — including a dot-import, which turns the call
//     into a bare identifier and is refused outright rather than silently unseen.
//   - It scanned only os.ReadDir(".") — the vmpool package directory — while
//     `go list -deps ./cmd/microvm-worker` includes internal/exec (whose runner.go
//     spawns bash) and internal/guestagent (whose agent.go spawns the guest shell).
//     Neither was scanned. All four packages in the worker's own module closure are now
//     covered, and the two spawn sites are declared, with reasons, in scannedPackages.
//
// And the pin now proves it FIRES: TestTheSpawnDetectorFiresOnEveryAliasSpelling plants
// violations in synthetic sources and asserts each is flagged. An absence-assertion that
// has never been shown to be capable of failing is asserting nothing — the rule this
// branch adopted after its own history of vacuous tests.

// scannedPackages lists every package in cmd/microvm-worker's module-local dependency
// closure (`go list -deps ./cmd/microvm-worker`, filtered to this module), with the files
// in each that are ALLOWED to spawn and why. A package missing from this map is a package
// this gate does not cover, which is how M1's second half happened; a file missing from a
// package's allow map must not spawn at all.
